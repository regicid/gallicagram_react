Benoît, whose coding skills were barely any better back then, exclaimed that it would be a brilliant idea to wrap this code in a Shiny app so that a computer-illiterate historian could plot curves too. Fast forward 5 years and a few thousand hours of work later, Benjamin and Benoît are now friends and slightly less incompetent. The project has expanded significantly, comprising several facets:",
